# My Personal Project

## The Performance Archive

This application stores data about performances. A performance has three pieces of information:
- A **title**,
- the **year** it was performed, and
- the **event** it was performed at.

Performances are stored in collections, which also have titles.

The application has many uses. It was initially conceived to help performers such as choirs or pianists keep track of
what they had performed and where, so that they could avoid having repeat performances in quick succession (*i.e.* only
two years apart). It could also serve as a sort of historical archive, so that certain memorable performances could be
located, making it easy to know what year or event a recording could be sorted under. However, it could function
just as well for fans, who perhaps want to make sure they never forget the details of their favourite performances
they've attended.

This project is of interest to me as it involves my love of music, and seems somewhat useful to me as a small-time
performer. As a pianist and choir member, I have participated in many local events, and I know something that always
needs planning is what songs to sing or play. It is always desirable to have a unique performance, and give the
audience something new. However, with multiple songs throughout the year for different events, and year-long intervals
between some events, it can be hard to remember what was performed recently. So, the idea for this archive system
was born.
